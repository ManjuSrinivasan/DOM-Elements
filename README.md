 The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. 
 It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
 The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
 Often, with JavaScript, you want to manipulate HTML elements.

To do so, you have to find the elements first. There are several ways to do this:

Finding HTML elements by id
Finding HTML elements by tag name
Finding HTML elements by class name
Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors
Finding HTML elements by HTML object collections
